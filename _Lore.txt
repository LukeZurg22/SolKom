-==============================LORE==============================-
THE PAST
* The Sarakaan Empire had collapsed nearly a century ago, and the Niecronian Empire had purged out the Sarak race 
from the galaxy altogether.
	Very few remain, and those who do, are incredibly bitter.

* The Circiabon have collapsed due to the encroaching Xyphonian Scourge in the Galactic East(tm). The Eternal War has
raged on for hundreds of centuries now, and it shows no signs of stopping. In truth, it cannot be stopped.

THE PRESENT
* Entire game takes place on the surface of a White Dwarf star named Sarak Major.
* Stations around the star harvest it for energy, but some stations send Chaos Cultists, bandits, or worse.

THE PLAYER
* You're just a shipment handler, minding their own business, transporting goods necessary for the survival of some stations.
* You forgot much of your past after staring into the star for just a little too long. Up to you to find out what / who you were.
* The player is a Rogue Niecronian who will eventually become a legendary figure for leading a valiant revolt against the Niecronians.
The revolt ultimately fails, but their name lives on, as "Ryak"

THE DANGER
* The enemies
* The Expense(tm)						: Losing Money constantly. Need money to afford REPAIRS, and FUEL
	-> Fuel
	-> Repairs							: 
	-> Lost cargo						: MAY BE BAD IDEA?

THE ENEMIES
Scavengers, Pirates (early game)		: DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM, PERHAPS LOOT-DROP WISE
										-> Pirates attack everything. Scavengers prefer to rummage through already-dead ships.
Former Sarak Loyalists (early game)		: HOSTILE GIVEN CERTAIN RANGE. COULD DEPEND ON REPUTATION/RENOWN?
Circiabon vessels (mid game)			: HOSTILE AND DANGEROUS. MODERATELY GOOD LOOT.
Circibon traders (mid game)				: TRAVELLING MERCHANTS THAT DEAL WITH POWERFUL STUFF. HARD TO KILL, RARE TO FIND.
Xyph scouting ships (late game)			: TYPICALLY AVOID COMBAT. IF ENGAGED, ARE A VERY DEADLY YET VALUABLE THREAT.
Niecronian scouting ships (end game)	: IMMEDIATELY HOSTILE GIVEN A RANGE. CAPABLE OF EASILY DESTROYING THE PLAYER.
											THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL, BUT GIVE THE HIGHEST-VALUE CARGO.
