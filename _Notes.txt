Tiny starsector game but with vintage story waypoint screen. Travel, food, towns, supplies, mass combat rules, dice rolls, d20 Modern main Character, simple graphics, food is orange, HP is green, done in Avalonia and/or OpenTK, Niecronians, Xyph, Circibon, Sarak, Arialial, Fuscia, and some other worlds are set in stone. Everything else is randomly generated. Faction management, gun customization.

Take scraps from Solar Kommand. Above a Sarak Star is how the game begins, w. backstory and whatnot. Special Characters still there.

Fleet combat could be simulated, or done by dice roll. Ala WH40K

Generate Galaxy:
Reach each PIXEL / CHUNK
Color 1 = Lowest chance for spawn
Color 2 = Middling chance
Color 3 = Highest chance
	Requirements:
- Random number generator with hardcoded DC chance to spawn.
- "Spawn" = instantiate an instance of some planet

Traits for NPCS:
Captain can be cruel, making them less likely to give into players request. Opposite is true.
Method: for every trait, an inverse must be possible. SolarKommand
Eu4-esque, or Stellaris?
What is a fleet?
- Overall morale
F_Health
F_DV
F_ATK VALUE

- Game ID
- Opinion modifier of each other.

Faction:
- Name
- Government type
- Stability			// Determines how internally stable one's faction is.
- Industrial Power		// Spent making ships
- Economic Power		// Spent buying things
- Personnel Power		// Spent creating units
- Affluence		// Spent manipulating other factions
- ! Technological Edge	// Provides a bonus against other factions.

- Associated Colour
Factions are referenced by a specialized ID. Not by name.

Add console commands to test shenanigans.

What is a ship, but a vessel?
F_MaxHealth (base health depends on classification)
- Ability Stats
- Hardness
- Classification (enum?)
- Guns
- Speed (FT)
- Speed (FTL)

Implement AMSCAL system as something; special mechanic?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=STAGE 1=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-
[!] Country modifiers.
[!] 	-> Country stats
[!] Random Sector instantiation
Random new-faction instantiation
Proper Planet modifiers
More planet stats (like, 2 -> 4 more. This has gotta be good.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=STAGE 2=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Flesh out country stats
Flesh out planet stats
Add more planet modifiers
Add custom faction creation (limited by console text input. Just for testing.)
Stress-test the generation of Sectors->Systems->Planets in the thousands, then hundreds-of thousands, then millions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Things To Add=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Faction -> Flag : /// Base64 string, or localized project image. Likely limit the flags and make it local for simplicity. - Flag (internally stored and base64 upload)
Formable nations
The Blade-Order (bonus vs Niecronians)
The Varchak Rebellion (can cause unrest in the Armada, and force its collapse)
Get-X (where X = Sector, System, Planet) to return info about specifics. Planets are numerical. Structures are alphabetical.
Xurnacht new planet names : "Harvest Zone" "Energy Source" "Portal Candidate"
Xyph new planet names : "Killing Fields" "Slaughter World" "Doomed Planet"
Pirate new planet names : "Den"
Ship guns classifications & gun related stuff from old Solar Kommand
Faction and planet modifiers on a planet. Get the type of enum and assess what respective stat that enum addresses.
Conquest bar on planets that drain manpower or invasion fleet power.

Country modifiers on planets will apply to the country anyway so long as that planet is under their control.
	-> Planet modifiers on countries will apply to *every* planet so long as it is under their control.
Add Durations for modifiers.
Add System-Wide modifiers.
Add Sector-Wide modifiers.
Add Galaxy-Wide modifiers.
Automate the creation of relations between all factions when a new faction is made. ResetRelations would be made worthless, then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Convieniences=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Generate random planets
Make much of the data-stuff text-file-centric, loading ony on game initialization. Allows for heavy modding.
Make governments view have government names on Y axis.
Localization Handling
	-> Localization Type (English, German, ...)
	-> Localization moved to text files
		-> Modifiers (Modifier.cs)
Note down in *THE SPREADSHEET*:
	-> All  Modifiers of all types and effects
	-> All base-game factions
	-> All planet types & base Sacre

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Unimportant Backburner Features=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Seperate Names for planets per faction under control.
Custom nation designer.
Niecronian faction has random events where planet is harassed by High Command who make demands, lest the country's government be reorganized to their preference.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Performance=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Turn Lists in
	SpaceSystem
	Sector
	Planet
	Faction
	-> Into arrays. Functions to navigate would need overhaul.
=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Planet Data Handling=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
(First / Last / Planet) Names read from text files that can be easily pasted-into and modified.
Planet Id: sector-planetindex
/* ::CUSTOM PLANETARY UPDATE THREAD::
* Update:
* Go through list.
* If planet dirty, update values visible.
* If not, move along.
*/
// Are planets recalculated every month tick via the passage of time? Or constantly? Flag planets and add them to a master list for updating if they're actually changed?
	- ADD FLAGGING INTO UPDATE LIST
	- MULTITHREADING: Have one thread just *dedicated* to going through a list and updating planets, while the other does whatever else it does.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Dynamic Mechanics=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Systems follow naming schemes. Planets within systems simply follow the System's name and append prime- alpha- delta- etc etc.

Planet Mechanics:
/// Modifiers
/* 
 * High Ore 	+1
 * Moderate Ore	0
 * Low Ore 	-1
 * No Ore 		-2
 * Radioactive
 * Polluted
 * Ruins
 * Time Sink (Deduction to production)	:	Time passes slower on the planet.
 * Time Desync (Faster production)	:	Time seems to pass by on the world more than the galaxy.
 */
How to do Sectors:
Divide the map into sectors. Foreach sector, Read each section pixels, and create systems for that sector.
